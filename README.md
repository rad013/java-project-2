This project is a console simulation restaurant game that uses multithreading to handle multiple customers and workers. The game involves serving food and drinks to customers before they lose patience and leave. The game has seven pages: home, login, register, menu, play, upgrade, and highscore.

In the home page, the user can choose between login or register. In the login and register page, the user can create an account with a username and password, or log in with an existing account. The user data is stored in an encrypted file using AES algorithms.

In the menu page, the user can choose to play the game or view the highscore list. In the play page, the user runs a restaurant that has a limited number of seats and lives. The user has to complete the customers’ requests by typing the names of the food and drink they ordered. The user earns points based on the price of the orders, which depends on the customers’ remaining patience. The user also loses a life when a customer leaves. The game ends when the user runs out of lives or exits the game.

The game has multiple levels, each lasting 60 seconds. After each level, the user can upgrade their restaurant by expanding the seats, buying decorations, purchasing ads, or hiring workers in the upgrade page. Each upgrade has a different effect on the game mechanics and a different cost that increases after each purchase. The user can exit or continue to the next level after upgrading.

In the highscore page, the user can see the scores of all users sorted in descending order using merge sort algorithms.

The project is written in java and uses object-oriented programming principles. The project demonstrates my skills in data structures, algorithms, encryption, file handling, and multithreading.
